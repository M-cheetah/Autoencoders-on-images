# Autoencoder-image-Denoising
### an autoencoder based approach to remove noise from an image

## Description:
Autoencoders are really emerging as solutions to many problems like image reconstruction, image denoising, dimensionality reduction, etc. One of the recent break through in autoencoder society is the invention of **GANs**, generative adversal networks can be used to produce novel data, hence from this all we can say autoencoders are the solution for many huge problems and issues mankind is having. WE used a 4 layered autoencoder to remove the noise in an image, the neurons used are 784-300-150-300-784.

## Dataset used:
Dataset we used is simple old classic MNIST, the reason was ease of computation and fast training of the model.
